# Weather-Dashboard

Weather-Dashboard web-page allows user to search for desired city and view current weather conditions while also view the upcoming weather patterns for up to five days in advance. The current weather condition section on the page after inputing a city name will also provide information on the cities UV index and color coordinate whether conditions are favorable or unfavorable. Web-page also saved users search history and provides a convient list for the user to refer to so they do not need to retype in city name.
